# Gym-OpenAI-Cartpole

Self-learning/Exploratory project to understand Reinforcement Learning

Computed reward plot per episode for various NN network architure.

Created the following simple network architecture
First Fully connected layer (nn.Linear in PyTorch) - input features - 4, output features - 24
Second Fully connected layer (nn.Linear in PyTorch) - input features - 24, output features - 36
Third Fully connected layer (nn.Linear in PyTorch) - input features - 36, output features - 2.

More layer architecture can be brain-stormed. 
This helped me understand how to much challenges are available in OpenAI gym!
